## PET PLACE LOCAL DEMO WEBSITE

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, get a database running. You will need Docker installed on your machine.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then, make sure all your node modules are installs

```bash
npm install
```

Next, make sure you modify the .env file to have the correct information for database connection.

Make sure the database is migrated.

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Look at your database

```bash
npx prisma studio
```
